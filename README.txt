This is a web project for a course using only HTML, avoiding CSS rules.
The purpose of this is to highlight the elements worked throughout the course.

The page is meant to be educational and it's fine tuned (the contents differ
from the original course example while mantaining the same structure)

The page deals with the structure of HTML, tables, forms, images (not videos),
and many other elements seen in the first chapter of the course

Note worthy mention: The page mentions the beautiful sixth generational 
Mustang (S550), and The Dark Horse. The links below the page
it's the reference to where I got the specific information.
